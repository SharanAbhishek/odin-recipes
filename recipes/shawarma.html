        </p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 cup Greek yogurt</li>
            <li>1 pound skinned, boned chicken breast, cut into thin strips</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>4 (6 inch) pita bread rounds</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon bottled minced garlic</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine Greek yogurt, garlic, lemon juice, cinnamon, oregano, salt, nutmeg, and cloves in a plastic container or resealable bag. Add chicken strips and shake until ingredients are evenly combined and chicken is well coated. Refrigerate at least 4 hours, up to overnight.</li>
            <li>When you are ready to make the sandwiches, heat olive oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. When oil is hot, add marinated chicken, and sear until golden brown on both sides and no longer pink in the centers, 8 to 10 minutes, depending on thickness of the chicken pieces.</li>
            <li>While the chicken is cooking, combine Greek yogurt, lemon juice, garlic, dill, garlic powder, and salt in a bowl or small resealable container, stir well to blend. Taste and adjust seasonings if desired.</li>
            <li>Once chicken is cooked and sauce is prepared, assemble sandwiches by dividing meat, lettuce, cucumber, and tomatoes between your pita. Add a generous smear of the yogurt sauce (to your taste preference).<li>
        </ol>
